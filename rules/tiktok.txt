**--- Branded Content & Monetization Policies ---**

Rule 1 (Disclosure Settings): All branded content, sponsorships, or promotions must be disclosed by toggling on the "Branded content" setting in the video post settings. A clear verbal disclosure (e.g., "Thanks to [Brand] for sponsoring this video") is also strongly recommended to maintain audience trust.

Rule 2 (Prohibited Products): Branded content must not feature or promote prohibited products, including cigarettes/e-cigarettes, drugs, weapons, counterfeit items, or get-rich-quick schemes. Political advertising and paid advocacy are also banned.

Rule 3 (For You Feed Eligibility): To be eligible for the For You feed, content must be original and authentic. Unoriginal, low-quality, and QR code-heavy content is likely to be suppressed. Videos that are just re-uploads from other sites with watermarks will have limited reach.

**--- Community Guidelines ---**

Rule 4 (Minor Safety): Content must not endanger minors. This includes depicting minors in risky situations, any form of child abuse, or content that could be sexually exploitative. TikTok's moderation is extremely strict on this.

Rule 5 (Dangerous Acts & Challenges): Do not show or promote dangerous activities, challenges, games, or stunts that could lead to injury. This includes depicting amateur stunts or providing instructions for dangerous activities.

Rule 6 (Hate Speech & Harassment): Content must not contain hate speech targeting protected groups or engage in severe bullying of private individuals. This includes targeted misgendering or deadnaming.

Rule 7 (Integrity & Authenticity): Do not spread misinformation that could cause significant harm to individuals or the public (e.g., medical misinformation, conspiracy theories). Do not engage in covert influence operations or manipulate platform features to artificially boost engagement.
