**--- Branded Content & Advertising Policies ---**

Rule 1 (Branded Content Tool): As with Instagram, all paid partnerships must be disclosed using the "Branded Content" tool, which adds a "Paid Partnership with [Brand]" label to the post.

Rule 2 (Prohibited & Restricted Content): Ads and branded content cannot promote illegal products/services, drugs, weapons, unsafe supplements, or multi-level marketing schemes. Content related to alcohol, dating, gambling, and financial services is heavily restricted and requires special permissions and targeting.

Rule 3 (Misleading Claims): Content must not contain deceptive, false, or misleading claims. This includes sensationalized health claims ("Miracle cure!") or unrealistic financial promises ("Zero risk, high return!").

**--- Community Standards ---**

Rule 4 (Violence & Incitement): Content must not incite, threaten, or glorify violence against any individual or group. Credible threats of harm are taken very seriously and can lead to immediate account removal.

Rule 5 (Hate Speech): Facebook prohibits attacks on people based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or medical condition. This is categorized into tiers of severity.

Rule 6 (Nudity & Sexual Activity): Content cannot depict sexually explicit conduct. Nudity is restricted, with exceptions for breastfeeding, health contexts, and art, but it is often flagged by automated systems.

Rule 7 (Fraud & Deception): You must not impersonate others or create a false presence to mislead people. This includes scams, phishing, and any attempt to fraudulently deceive users for financial or personal gain.
