**--- Branded Content & Advertising Policies ---**

Rule 1 (Branded Content Tool): All content created as part of a paid partnership must use Instagram's official "Paid Partnership" label. This is a non-negotiable requirement from the platform. A verbal disclosure is also highly recommended for transparency.

Rule 2 (Prohibited Industries): You cannot create branded content that promotes tobacco products, weapons, ammunition, explosives, or illegal drugs/supplements. Content related to gambling or cryptocurrency is heavily restricted and often not allowed for branded content.

Rule 3 (Implicit Brand Association): Even if not directly paid, you must not create content that falsely implies a partnership with a brand. Do not use brand logos or trademarks in a way that suggests an official endorsement when one does not exist.

**--- Community Guidelines ---**

Rule 4 (Authentic Engagement): You must not artificially collect likes, followers, or shares. Do not run "engagement bait" promotions like "Share this post to 5 friends to enter the giveaway" or "Everyone who comments gets a follow."

Rule 5 (Graphic & Sensitive Content): The video must not contain extreme graphic violence, content that glorifies self-harm, or sexually explicit material. Nudity is restricted, especially in a pornographic context.

Rule 6 (Regulated Goods): The video must not attempt to sell, trade, or facilitate the private sale of firearms, alcohol, tobacco, or live animals between individuals.

Rule 7 (Hate Speech & Bullying): Content must not attack or harass individuals or groups based on protected attributes (race, religion, gender, etc.). This includes targeted bullying, threats, and sharing private information to harass someone.
