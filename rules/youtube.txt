**--- Monetization & Advertising Policies ---**

Rule 1 (Paid Promotion Disclosure): All paid promotions, sponsorships, or endorsements must be clearly disclosed. This can be done by checking YouTube's "Includes paid promotion" box AND by including a verbal disclosure within the first 60 seconds of the video. Acceptable verbal phrases include 'sponsored by', 'paid partnership', 'advertisement', and 'ad'. Failure to do both can lead to video removal or demonetization.

Rule 2 (Unsubstantiated Claims): The video must not contain absolute or "guaranteed" claims, especially in finance, health, or wellness categories. Flag any use of phrases like 'guaranteed results', 'guaranteed profit', 'will cure', 'no risk', 'risk-free', 'get rich quick', or any promise of a specific outcome without significant scientific evidence.

Rule 3 (Affiliate Link Policy): If the video or description contains affiliate links, you must disclose this to the audience. A common disclosure is "This description contains affiliate links. If you purchase a product through one of them, I will receive a commission (at no additional cost to you)."

**--- Community Guidelines ---**

Rule 4 (Harmful or Dangerous Content): The video must not promote, encourage, or show dangerous acts that could lead to serious physical harm or death. This includes challenges, pranks, or instructional videos on activities like building weapons or using illegal substances.

Rule 5 (Hate Speech): Content must not promote violence or hatred against individuals or groups based on race, ethnicity, religion, disability, age, nationality, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender, or gender identity.

Rule 6 (Sensitive Content): The video must not contain graphic violence, gore, or sexually explicit material. Nudity is only acceptable in specific educational, scientific, or artistic contexts and must be properly age-gated.

Rule 7 (Child Safety): Content featuring minors must not place them in dangerous, embarrassing, or sexually suggestive situations. Personal information about minors should never be shared.
